# Fix_My_Code_Challenge

In this series of projects provided by ALX/Holberton School, I was presented with various buggy codes to debug. These challenges encompassed a variety of programming languages, including C, Python, and JavaScript, among others. While I had some familiarity with certain languages, there were others that I was not familiar with. It is important to note that participation in this project was completely optional. The following are the projects in the series:
